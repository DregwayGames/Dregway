###Level Design:

###Enemies:

###Equipment/items:

###What makes it unique?

###Goal:

###"""Plot""":

###Different Game Systems?
1. Turn based/scheduled combat system
2. Two effective actions (ie move -> shoot), but combat actions end turn (can't shoot -> move)
3. rules of game change based on equipment (ie: powered suits allow you to crush through most walls, jump to higher elevations/accross floor, etc - but also eliminate any element of surprise you could possibly have, and may become life-threatening when damaged)
